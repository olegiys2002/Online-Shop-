Hello, this is my first project , where you can find such patterns as UnitOfWork , Repository and clean architercture, DTO.
The project has simple interface ,because i was focus on backend part of application.
I used for this project such technologies as Asp net core MVC, Entity Framework,asp core Identity,User secrets.
In this application we have an admin , he can manage users,products (CRUD) ,orders.
ALso we have customers , they have permament cart and order list.
Unregistered users also can add products in cart and make orders , but after the session ends , they will lost products in cart and orders, but orders can see admin,
which can connect with any user that made order by his telephone number which user fills in order form.
This is a main fuctional in my application
